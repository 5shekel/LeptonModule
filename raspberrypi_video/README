This example is meant for Raspberry PI, and has been tested on Raspberry PI model B, I think.

It has been tested on the OS Raspbian.

In order to build this example, you'll have to first install the qt4-dev-tools package, which allows compiling of QT applications.

You'll also need to enable the SPI interface on the raspi.

Once everything's in place, cd into the raspberrypi_video folder, and run the command:

	qmake -project && qmake && make

This will compile the application.

In order for the application to run properly, a lepton camera must be attached in a specific way to the SPI, power, and ground pins of the Raspi's GPIO interface.

Lepton's CS and GND pins should be connected to ground.
Lepton's MISO pin should be connected to RasPI's MISO pin.
Lepton's CLK pin should be connected to RasPI's SCLK pin.
Lepton's VIN pin should be connected to RasPI's 3v3 pin.
